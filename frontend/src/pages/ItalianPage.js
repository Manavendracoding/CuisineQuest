                Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, especially between the north and the south of Italy. It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world. Italian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots stretching to antiquity. Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced until the 18th century.

                Italian cuisine is characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Traditional meals in Italy consist of several courses, with pasta being a staple of the Italian diet, followed by meats and vegetables, and ending with desserts and coffee. Each region has its own specialties, primarily at the regional level, but also at the provincial level.
